# Awesome Maintainer Funding
[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of funding programs supporting the _awesome_ work of Open Source maintainers. 

Something's missing or wrong? Don't hesitate to [contribute](./CONTRIBUTING.md), thanks! ❤️

# Criteria
We're not collecting all kinds of FOSS funding programs, instead this list focuses on funding programs with the following qualities:
1. Explicit support of general maintenance work. 
2. Availability for solo maintainers.
3. The maximum amount compares to at least 3 months full time work.
4. Actively accepting applications.
5. Ideally, no regional restrictions.*

_\* Sanctions may exclude certain countries or citizenships of maintainers._

For currently closed programs, or those not funding maintenance work, or which are just donation platforms or market places, please see below.

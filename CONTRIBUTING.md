# Contributing 

Please help keep this list up to date. The author crowd-sourced the initial list using a Mastodon [toot](https://chaos.social/@mechko/115922603775962768), but it inevitably becomes outdated over time. 

You can either raise an issue or submit a pull request directly. Please ensure you don't add arbitrary open source funding programs - we want to focus on programs that support the _awesome_ work of FOSS maintainers according to the criteria outlined in the README. 

Thanks in advance! ❤️
